What is this? and why am I doing it?

This is the first seed of my [digital garden](/digital_garden){: .internal-link}. A seed 
that contains the blueprint of the tree (format) and the initial nutrition (content) to grow,
 although it's _just_ a seed.  

## 📓 Content
I'm planning to store my findings, learnings, and projects about anything that interests me; 
a reshuffled version of existing ideas and knowledge, so _nothing original_.

Mostly the followings topics: 
* 🥘 Diet
* 📈 Self-tracking
* 🧘‍♂️ Meditation
* ♻ Habits
* 💻 Tech

## 📘 Format 

I'm not planning to write essays, writing a post sounds intimidating and might stop me to produce anything 
altogether. However, writing a couple of sort notes seems more approachable. Because of this, the format 
of the site supposed to be a [digital garden](/digital_garden){: .internal-link} 
that I would like to grow slowly, gradually, and consistently.

## ❓ Why 

I've always thought that I'm late to this party, everything has been 
written, there is no new content that can be created or be entertaining, the 
blog market is full, and what I want to write is boring anyways. Probably all of this 
is true to a certain degree, but writing in public is **not _(just)_ about the reader.**
I've been writing diaries/daily notes and personal wikis since 2007, but 
never shared them. 

Recently I noticed a trend in the content bubble I consume, some of the creators started 
encouraging their consumer to start their public content creation.

and now I'm convinced. 

**What do I expect from this?**
 - some healthy pressure to produce better quality notes
 - constructive feedback from readers
 - improvement in my thought process and writing
