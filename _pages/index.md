# Welcome to my digital garden ðŸŒ±

I think calling the first post of a digital garden, seed is more than 

## Content
I'm planning to store my findings, learnings and projects about anything that interests me.
Mostly the followings:
* How to live  
  - Health: Mental, physical, diet 
  - Money: How to save, invest 
  - Time: Productivity 
* Tech realated projects
but _nothing original_. This is just a reshuffled version of existing ideas and knowledge.

## Format 

I'm not planning to write essays. This site supposed to be a [[digital 
garden]] with small interconnected notes. The relationship between the notes 
should make them more valuable . I would like to grow it gradually, slowly 
and consistently.

I've been using [[Roam]] for more than half a year now and it totally change how I
think about note taking and knowledge managment. This site supposed to be a distiled 
form of my knowledge store in [[Roam]], so it will keep the it's structure. 

## Why 

I've always thought that I'm late to this blogging party, everything has been 
written, there is no new content that can be created or be entertaining, the 
blog market is full, and what I want to write is boring. Probably all of this 
is true to a certain degree, but writting in public is **not _(just)_ about the reader.**
I've been writing diaries/daily notes and personal wikies since 2007, but 
never shared them.
