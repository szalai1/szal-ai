Roam is a notetaking app that supports easiy bidirectional linking between notes, which makes 
 it extremly useful. This means links are not only to navigate to 
 the referenced pages, but the reference automatically appears on the 
 linked page too.

I started using it around 2020-05 and changed how I take notes.
